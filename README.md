## Getting Started

To get started with the web scraper, follow these simple steps:

1.  Install the scraper using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2.  Create a new instance of the scraper: `scraper = WebScraper()`
3.  Define your scraping task: `scraper.add_task(url, selector, handler)`
4.  Run the scraper: `scraper.run()`

## Installation

To install the web scraper, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all necessary dependencies and libraries.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the web scraper:

```python
from web_scraper import WebScraper

# Create a new instance of the scraper
scraper = WebScraper()

# Define a scraping task
scraper.add_task(
    url="https://example.com",
    selector=".title",
    handler=lambda x: x.text.strip()
)

# Run the scraper
scraper.run()
```

This will scrape the title from the webpage and print the result.

## Examples

*   Scrape all links on a webpage:

    ```python
scraper.add_task(
    url="https://example.com",
    selector="a",
    handler=lambda x: x.get("href")
)
```

*   Scrape all images on a webpage:

    ```python
scraper.add_task(
    url="https://example.com",
    selector="img",
    handler=lambda x: x.get("src")
)
```

*   Scrape data from a table:

    ```python
scraper.add_task(
    url="https://example.com",
    selector="table tr",
    handler=lambda x: [td.text.strip() for td in x.find_all("td")]
)
```
